		<p>The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War">Great Emu War of 1932</a></b> was an
		operation undertaken by the Australian Army between November and December of 1932.
		It was planned by the Minister for Defense, Sir George Pearce.<br></p>

		<p>The objective was to eliminate much of the local emu population to Western Australia,
		which had contributed to farmers' loss of crops.<br> <br>
		
		In terms of this, the plan was an abysmal failure. The Battles of the Dam, Campion, etc. were
		declared to be emu victories as the majority of emus, several times, got away from military troops
		attempting to shoot at them. Military leadership even compared the emus to tanks, proclaiming that "if we had the military 
		capacity of these birds, it would face any army in the world".</p>
